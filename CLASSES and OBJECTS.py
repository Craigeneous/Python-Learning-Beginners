# Classes are groups of data and functions that describe a particular template. Objects are individual instances of that
# class template being used. Classes can be used to describe almost anything:-
# A class for dogs might include breed, age, colouration, a true/false for being chipped.
# A class for merging documents might include the first document, the second, the name of the new merged document.
# A class for questions; question and answer, perhaps a weighting for each answer.
